        > With the added notion of weakness, by which man is led into a mistake or prompted to sin

    * Yeshua often uses “Son of Man” to refer to Himself.

    * [Mark 2:27 NKJV][mar227] Tells us _why_ the Sabbath exists:
    > And He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.
    * [Luke 4:16 NKJV][luk416] Tells us what Yeshua would do on the Sabbath:
    > So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. _And as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day_, and stood up to read.

The KJV and NKJV add the word “even” to the verse:

> *For the Son of man is Lord **even** of the sabbath day.* (KJV)

* **even:** Conjunction
    * Strong’s G2532: **καί**
    * Generally translated as “and”. In this case, translated “even”.
        * Other examples where καί is translated “even”: Matthew 5:46, Matthew 10:30, Mark 1:27, Luke 10:17
    * Adding “even” seems to *emphasize* Yeshua’s lordship over Shabbat: i.e.
    “For the Son of man is Lord **of everything, _including_** of the sabbath day.”

### The Form of the Verse

The form of the verse is a “nominal sentence”, *defining* the Subject rather than describing an action the Subject takes.

The verse is itself an independent clause, connected to the previous verses.
It would be an independent, complete sentence if it did not begin with the conjunction “For”.

**Since this verse connects to the previous verses, how much of the previous verses is necessary to describe this verse?**

> [Matthew 12:1-8 NKJV] At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!” But He said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the showbread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless? Yet I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the temple. But if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”

### Preparation

#### Explanation of the Text

This verse is a “nominal sentence”, *defining* the Subject rather than describing the Subject’s action.

This verse is connected to the previous verse: 
[Matthew 12:7][matt127] 
> "But if you had known what this means, [*‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’*][hos66] you would not have condemned the guiltless.”

* The quoted verse is [Hosea 6:6][hos66]:
> For I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.

It is interesting that [Mark 2:27-28][mar227] states that:
> “The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. **Therefore** the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.”. (Emphasis mine)

So, Sabbath was made for man’s benefit, and Yeshua has ownership of it.

#### Illustration of the Text

You work for a business. 
The business has a dress code.
You abide by the dress code.
The Boss shows up in jeans and a T-shirt.

Is that fair?
No.

Is that good leadership?
Possibly not.

But the Boss is the Boss.
The business is his.
He can do what he wants with it.

#### Application of the Text

It seems that the application of Matthew 12:8 is to treat the Sabbath as though it belongs to Yeshua, because it does.
