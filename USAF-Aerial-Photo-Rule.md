    * “Front” of rule:
    * Simple problem: proportions
        * Altitude : Focal Length :: Actual Size : Image Size
* Altitude: what aircraft were they thinking of? Max Altitude 250,000’
    * “...to permit the use of this slide rule in oblique photography computations”
    * Higher than contemporary aerial photography. 40,000’ +
    * Too low and too early for orbital platforms.
        * Old “Edge of Space” was 50 mi = 264,000’
        * Kármán line: 100km = 330,000’
        * Sputnik 1: 1957, 134mi x 583mi, 707,520’ x 3,078,240’
    * V-2?
        * 55 mi = 291,000’
        * The V-2 wasn't used for this, but could be representative of suborbital photo platform
    * Balloons?
        * Max altitude about 100,000’

        * “a photo interpreter could detect a golf ball from an altitude of 45,000 feet (14,000 m)”
    * Some RB-57D carried a camera of 730cm focal length (?)
    * K-17

* “Rear” of rule: What problems to solve for photo interpreters?

    * A scale without B?
    * DI scale, no CI?
    * CF / DF / CIF
    * T & S scales on slide
    * A, K, and L on stators

* Design Decisions

#### Katz, p. 350

* Altitude: “extended to about 250,000 to permit the use of this slide rule in oblique photography computations”
* “Various arrows and marks for
    * image speed
    * cycling time computations
* Indices added for 96, 144, 240 inch lenses
* Additional considerations for aerial photographers and staff photo officers (not just aerial photo interpreters
* Reverse side to have “the normal, folded, and inverted scales”
    * C, D, CF, DF, DIF, DI, A & K, S & T, and L

#### Katz, p. 366

* Discusses calculating √(A² + B²) “on a slide rule like the K & E Log Log Deci-trig”.
    * “The key to success with this method depends on the photo-interpreter's having a suitable slide rule. He doesn't have it yet, but will in the future”

* Errors in manual?
* U2 / Aerial photography sites
