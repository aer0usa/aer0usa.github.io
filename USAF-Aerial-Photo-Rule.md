# Pickett USAF Aerial Photography Slide Rules

* They looked interesting to me
* What problems were they meant to solve?
    * “Front” of rule:
    * Simple problem: proportions
        * Altitude : Focal Length :: Actual Size : Image Size
* Altitude: what aircraft were they thinking of? Max Altitude 250,000’
    * Higher than contemporary aerial photography. 40,000’ +
    * Too low and early for orbital platforms.
        * Old “Edge of Space” was 50 mi = 264,000’
        * Kármán line: 100km = 330,000’
        * Sputnik 1: 1957, 134mi x 583mi, 707,520’ x 3,078,240’
    * Balloons?
        * Max altitude about 100,000’
