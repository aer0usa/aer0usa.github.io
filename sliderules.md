# Slide Rules

## Journal of the Oughtred Society

I wrote an article for the [JOS](https://www.oughtred.org/journal.shtml) about the first Slide Rule I bought myself, the Pickett Model 700 USAF Aerial Photography Slide Rule:
[Pickett USAF Aerial Photography Slide Rules](./USAF-Aerial-Photo-Rule.html)
It was published in [JOS Volume 32, No. 1, 2023](http://osgalleries.org/journal/displayarticle.cgi?match=32.1/V32.1P55.pdf).

## Concise Model CTCS-552
[Concise Page on ISRM](https://www.sliderulemuseum.com/Concise.htm)

![CTCS-552](./images/Concise-CTCS-552.jpg)

This was in a box of stuff Dad said I could have if I was interested when I was a kid.
There were also some James Bond novels and a little pocket tool set.

I thought the design of the scales was interesting, with the neat numbers and ticks, and the index indicators on C and D.
It seemed clean and purposeful.

The reference card with all of its conversion factors and tables, the table of elements, and rulers were powerful tools to my little _Star Trek_ addled mind.

I played with it like a toy and left it exposed to sunlight in a window sill. If I remember correctly, the sunlight is what hurt it worst.

When Dad visited in December 2021, I showed him my collection and told him I got this Concise from him.
He said he didn't remember it.
In fact, he said the slide rule he used was a yellow pocket-size Pickett!
He said he liked Picketts because they were “built like tanks” and did anyone else even make slide rules?
He forgot which model he had, though.

* From Dad, 1976?
* Scales: 4in || D ( C, CI, L, A, K) || 10cm
* Table of the Elements and Temperature Conversion Chart on back
* Insert ©1966
    * Length, Area, Weight, Volume, Decimal Equivalents, Velocity, Gas Constants, Flow Rate, Energy, Pressure, Useful Constants
* Includes manual
    * Manual © 1967
* Includes red vinyl case
* Imprinted "Sturgis Equipment Company"
* Poor condition, but complete and functional. Taped together.
    * I played with it like a toy and left it exposed to sunlight in a window sill. If I remember correctly, the sunlight is what hurt it worst.

![Aristo Studio Nr. 868](./images/Aristo-868.jpg)

I was browsing Ebay and found this rule at a good price, so I ordered it.
I like Aristo rules’ design and layout, so this rule is a fun “compare and contrast” to my [Pickett Model 600](#pickett600) and [Aristo 867U Darmstadt](#aristo867u).

* Purchased July 7, 2023
    * Ebay
    * $29.78 Shipped
    * Arrived July 14, 2023
* Scales:
    * Front: LL01, LL02, LL03, A [ B, L, K, C ] D, LL3, LL2, LL1
    * Back: T, ST, DF [ CF, CIF, CI, C ] D, P, S
* Cursor
    * Multiple hairlines: PS, KW, “36”, π/4
    * The cursor is installed upside-down:
    The “Aristo” logotype on the cursor bar is upside-down.
    The “kW” and “HP” marks are over C and D scales instead of A and B scales
    * Cursor screws covered in some sort of “gunge”.
    That cleaned up with a spudger.
    * I need to figure out how to remove the cursor so I can clean it and turn it over.
        * **Update:** I disassembled the cursor and washed it, and the rest of the rule, with mild dish soap and water.
        The “36” cursor mark washed away partially and is faint now.
        The mark is visible, and the cursor is oriented correctly now.
* Includes Leather Case
* Manufacturing Code Stamp “6013”
    * Oughtred Society Journal Article: [DENNERT & PAPE and ARISTO Slide Rules 1872 - 1978](https://osgalleries.org/journal/displayarticle.cgi?match=6.1/V6.1P4.pdf)
    * 1960, Lot 13
    * The “13” appears to be double-stamped. The “60” is harder to read.
    * An Aristo rule manufactured in 1960 ought to have an alphanumeric code, according to the JOS article linked above.
    Maybe I have read this incorrectly.
* Good Condition
    * “Gutmann H.” engraved between “75” and 80 marks on S scale.
    * “GH” engraved on edge of rule opposite Manufacturing Code.
* Includes Leather Case
    * Case in Good Condition

## Pickett Model N700-T A-2
### "U. S. AIR FORCE AERIAL PHOTO SLIDE RULE TYPE A-2"
### [Pickett Page on ISRM](https://www.sliderulemuseum.com/Pickett.htm)

![Model N700-T A-2](./images/Pickett-N700T.jpg)

I had been meaning to order one of these “New In Box” Pickett Model N700-T rules from Sphere Research Slide Rule Universe for some time.
I probably didn't need another Model 700, but the 700 was the lowest-price “New In Box” Pickett at the Slide Rule Universe, and I really like the 700.
It came to my attention that Sphere Research was planning to close down by the end of the year, so I placed my order.

When it arrived, I was pleased at the excellent condition of the box and its contents.
The rule was in a plastic sleeve inside its leather case, and there was something sticky sticking the sleeve to the rule.
I peeled the sleeve off the rule, which left sticky residue on the “Front” of the rule, but not on the back.
I washed the rule with Dawn dish soap and water, and that removed the residue from the face of the rule and the sliding surfaces.
Now it is good as new!

I was surprised to see the slide tension springs.
I have a good assortment of Pickett pocket rules, and none of my others have the tension springs.
I was beginning to believe that none of Pickett’s pocket rules came with the tension springs, but here they are.
I have seen pictures on ISRM of Pickett pocket rules with cutouts on the rails that would seem to accommodate tension springs, but I wasn't sure that’s what the cutouts were for.
Now I know.

I was also glad to see this rule has a “Style 5” logo, since I didn't have any examples of that.

So, I have another Pickett Model 700, and I paid more for it than I usually like to pay for a rule.
However, with its features and its condition, I’m glad I got it.

### [This page on “Bob’s Calculators and Slide Rules”](https://sites.google.com/site/bobscalculatorsandsliderules/home/slide-rules/halden) shows restoration of a Halden Calculex

![Halden Calculex](./images/halden_calculex.jpg)

Alyssa got this for me!
This is a very nice little circular rule that has suffered some sort of catastrophe in its life.
It is missing its metal outer ring and handle, and one of its two glass pieces.
The scales look like they may be tarnished.
The rivets seem to be showing through the faces of the outer scales.
However, the inner and outer scales move easily, as does the glass.

I think I could make a replacement glass with a hairline out of Plexiglas if I can find the correct thickness.
The outer ring and handle would be more of a challenge.

![Halden Calculex Instruction Manual](./images/halden_calculex_manual.jpg)
Maybe the best part of this is the tiny leather-bound instruction manual.
The manual is well-written, with lots of operation examples and reference tables.
They packed a lot of information on its 94 tiny pages.
The last page, originally blank, has handwritten notes for “Time allowed”, apparently for the number of hours to complete X operations at Y minutes each.
The note appears to have been written with a fountain pen with green ink.
The manual has no copyright date.

    * Missing outer ring and handle

## Pickett Model 903

![Pickett Model 903](./images/Pickett-903.jpg)

One day, I joined the ISRM Google Meet video call.
I met Mike Konshak, George, and Mike (If I recall correctly, it was Mike Syphers of [Following the Rules](https://followingtherules.info/)), and we had a fun chat about slide rules, home ownership, motorcycles, and other topics.
We started to talk about replacement parts for Pickett rules, and Mike K showed a Pickett 903 he had that needed a cursor.
He showed us replacing its cursor with the cursor from a different, later Pickett, and called it a “Frankenrule”.
He also demonstrated adding a hairline to a Plexiglas reproduction cursor glass he had cut and drilled earlier to match early Pickett pocket rules.
Since he had just sent me the Dietzgen and UTO recently, he had my address, so he sent me the “Frankenrule” and the reproduction cursor glass he had just marked.

This was a nice, unexpected gift!
The 903 was not on my radar, but it's a nice compare-and-contrast to my 902, and to the “rear” of the 700/520.

## Vernon Sterling Slide Rule Tie Bar

![Vernon Sterling Slide Rule Tie Bar](./images/Vernon-Tie-Bar.jpg)

I was getting ready to go to a wedding, so I would be be wearing a suit and tie for the first time in a long time. We went and bought the suit and tie, and I thought, “It's too bad I don't have one of those neat little slide rule tie bars to go with this.”

A couple minutes later, I was browsing eBay.

A couple minutes and thirty dollars later, I had placed an order.

A couple days later, I had a beautiful tiny slide rule tie bar!

The slide and cursor slide, the cursor has a faint hairline printed on it, and it has A, C, and D scales! It’s only good for one or two significant digits, but it works!

# Wish List

My “Wish List” keeps getting shorter!

---

<a name="loglogrules"></a>
## Log-Log Rules

### Pickett Model Log-Log Rules

The Pickett [Model 500](#pickett500), [Model 800](#pickett800T), [Model 803](#pickettn803t), Model 2, Model 3, and [Model 4](#pickettn4) seem to make up a “spectrum” of Log-Log rules.
I probably don’t need ALL of them in my collection.
Yet, I am strangely compelled…

Also, an N3P or an N4P would be great, but are harder to come by.

### Aristo Studio 968

I enjoy the nice graphic design of Aristo slide rules.
I also like Aristo’s scale layout, with the trig scales on the body, and the addition of a P scale.

**Update:** I now have an [868 Studio](#aristo868) and an [0968 Studio](#aristo0968)!

### Nestler 0130 MultiMath
### Post Versalog

Lys got me a lovely [Post Versalog](#postversalog)!

### K&E Log-Log Rules

I have lumped the K&E rules together because there are a lot of K&E Log-Log rules, and I am not well-versed in the differences between all of them.
The 4081-3s seem to be the “classic” K&E Log-Log rules.
I like the 4181-1 pocket-size Log-Log rules.
The 68-1100 “Deci-Lon” seems to be the flagship, like the [Pickett N4](#pickettn4).

I have started by adopting a [K & E 4092-3](#ke4092), which is an earlier-style Log-Log rule, with one LL0 scale indexed to A.

<a name="misc"></a>
## Misc

### Pickett Model 1010SL

The Pickett Model 1010 is a nice trig rule.
It appears to be an evolution of the [Model 1000](#pickett1000).
The 1010SL looks like the model 1010, but with Square Root scales in addition to the A and B scales.
I don’t think I need a 1000 and a 1010, but the 1010SL is an interesting enough variation that I’d like one.
