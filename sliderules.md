## Concise Model CTCS-552
[Concise Page on ISRM](https://www.sliderulemuseum.com/Concise.htm)

![CTCS-552](./images/Concise-CTCS-552.jpg)

* From Dad, 1976?
* Scales: 4in || D ( C, CI, L, A, K) || 10cm
* Table of the Elements and Temperature Conversion Chart on back
* Insert ©1966
    * Length, Area, Weight, Volume, Decimal Equivalents, Velocity, Gas Constants, Flow Rate, Energy, Pressure, Useful Constants
* Includes manual
    * Manual © 1967
* Includes red vinyl case
* Imprinted "Sturgis Equipment Company"
* Poor condition, but complete and functional. Taped together.
    * I played with it like a toy and left it exposed to sunlight in a window sill. If I remember correctly, the sunlight is what hurt it worst.
* **Update:** When Dad visited in December 2021, I showed him my collection and told him I got this Concise from him.
He said he didn't remember it.
In fact, his slide rule was a yellow pocket-size Pickett!
He said he liked Picketts because they were “built like tanks” and did anyone else even make slide rules?
He forgot which model he had, though.
