# My Faith

I am saved by faith in Messiah Yeshua.
Nothing else I can do will “earn” salvation for me from my sins.

I try to be intentional about my faith.
Here are some of my guiding verses:

* Luke 9:23 - “And He said to them all, ‘If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.’ ”
	* “take up his cross daily” = The relationship with God is not a one-time decision, but a lifestyle and a series of choices each day.
* Philippians 2:12 - “Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.”
	* “work out your own salvation with fear and trembling” = I must think about and *choose* what will bring me closer to God.
* Romans 7:18-20 - “For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, Rom 7:17 I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.”
	* “For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want.” = Temptation to do wrong still exists; I must recognize and resist this. The temptation doesn't go away just because I now belong to God by Yeshua.
