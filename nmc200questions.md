# New Members Class "Messianic Foundations"
## Chapter Questions

### 1. Describe three aspects/attributes of G-d's **everlasting love** (including scripture references):

a. **Personal**

G-d's love is **Personal**.
G-d is not an impersonal "force of the universe" nor a tyrant.
He cares for His chosen people, and for His entire creation.
He loves us enough to correct us and enough to make sacrifices for our benefit.

*For G-d so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.* -John 3:16

*The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.* - 2 Peter 3:9

b. **Perpetual**

G-d's love is **Perpetual**.
G-d is eternal.
G-d does not change.
So if G-d loves us, He has always loved us, and always will.

*The LORD has appeared of old to me, saying: "Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love; Therefore with lovingkindness I have drawn you."* - Jeremiah 31:3

*"Come near to Me, hear this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; From the time that it was, I was there. And now the Lord GOD and His Spirit Have sent Me."* - Isaiah 48:16

G-d's love does not change.
He does not get "fed up" with us.

*I say then, has G-d cast away His people? Certainly not! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. G-d has not cast away His people whom He foreknew.…* - Romans 11:1-2

c. **Powerful**

G-d's love is **Powerful**.
His love saves us, spiritually and physically.

*"And because He loved your fathers, therefore He chose their descendants after them; and He brought you out of Egypt with His Presence, with His mighty power,* - Deuteronomy 4:37

*For G-d so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.* -John 3:16

### 2. **To the Jew First…**

a. Define "to the Jew first" in context of G-d's Word (i.e., what does this phrase mean)

"To the Jew first" means *primarily* to the Jew, and **not** first *chronologically*.
The Jewish people are first in G-d's *priority*, as G-d's chosen people.

b. Explain why this directive is still applicable/necessary to demonstrate G-d's faithfulness.

The directive "to the Jew first" is necessary as testimony of G-d's faithfulness and constancy.
G-d has **not** nullified nor forgotten His promises to the Jewish people.
The Good News of Messiah "to the Jew first" is testimony that He keeps His promises.
He did not change his mind and remove His covenant.

I liked the idea of G-d's promises being "irreducably complex".
Either **ALL** of His promises are true, or **none** of it is true.

### 3. Explain why Messianic Congregations are a necessary testimony of G-d (faithful, effective, and fulfilling).

Messianic Congregations are an expression of God's *faithfulness*.
If God was not faithful, the Jews might not be God's chosen people any more.
However, God has kept His people with His faithfulness and power.
God wants His chosen people to remain Jewish *in Messiah*.
Messianic Congregations are a demonstration that God's chosen people are still extant and still relevant, and that the Gentiles' salvation is *through* the Jews.

Messianic Congregations are *effective*, not in the sense of adding to the number of people converted or saved, but in the communication of God's plan to Jews and Gentiles.
God keeps a *remnant* for His testimony of faithfulness.

Psalm 137:5

Romans 15:25-27 God's program: "To the Jew first..."

Messianic are a *fulfillment* of God's Great Commission in Matthew 8:18-28.
Your *faith* in Messiah Yeshua saves you.
Discipleship doesn't save you, but faithfulness is a *result* of discipleship.
Discipleship makes you *functional* in faithfulness.
