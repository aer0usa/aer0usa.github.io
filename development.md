# Software Development

I write software for a living, and also as a hobby.

## The tools I use

I use some version of [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) for all of my text editing.
It is lightweight, extensible, and available on any platform.
Currently, I use [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/).

Since I found out about Markdown and Pandoc, Neovim is my favorite word processor.
I write these pages in Markdown, and I have written a Bash script that uses Pandoc to turn them into static html, attaching a header, footer, and CSS.
