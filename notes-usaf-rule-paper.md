# Notes: Pickett USAF Aerial Photography Slide Rules
### Quotes

> Briefly stated, precision refers to the reproducibility of the measurement operation, whereas accuracy refers to the essential truth of the measurement, i.e. its nearness to the true value.  
Katz, page 351 (reference)

> It is a serious and pernicious fallacy to believe that because computations are made with a modern electric calculator, "answers" can be written down embodying all the figures cast up by the machinations of the calculator.  
Katz, page 351 (reference)

> If anyone wants to argue with this definition, let him write his own paper.
Katz, Some Ramblings and Musings on Tactical Reconnaissance, page 1 (reference)

> The logarithmic cycle on the interpreter's side of the rule will be 2.5 inches long, for four of these cycles are needed to cover the range 10⁴ to 1.
> A ten inch logarithmic scale, such as the C scale on a standard 10 inch slide rule, can be read to approximately 0.1 %; hence the 2.5 inch log cycle can be read to about 0.4%-one part in 250.
> It will become clear in the next section that such precision, if accompanied by the expected accuracy in manufacture, is at least ten times better than the accuracy of most photo-interpretation.  
Katz, page 350 (reference)

> It is clear from all of the foregoing material that:  
> a) In a truly vertical photograph dI/I may be 4%.  
> b) In a slightly tilted photograph, assumed to be vertical, the scale may easily vary by several per cent from one side to the other.  
> c) Focal plane shutters may easily contribute about one per cent distortion.  
> In the absence of non-availability of probability (or frequency) distributions for each of the quantities contributing to final error, it is impossible to estimate the probability of errors of a given size.
> It can be stated that under some easily realized circumstances, errors of 8% to 10% are not impossible.
> More important it can be stated that accuracies of 1% or less (such as the photo-interpreter's one part in 300) are extremely improbable.

* Altitude: “extended to about 250,000 to permit the use of this slide rule in oblique photography computations”
* “Various arrows and marks for
    * image speed
    * cycling time computations
* Indices added for 96, 144, 240 inch lenses
* Additional considerations for aerial photographers and staff photo officers (not just aerial photo interpreters
* Reverse side to have “the normal, folded, and inverted scales”
    * C, D, CF, DF, DIF, DI, A & K, S & T, and L

#### Katz, p. 366

* Discusses calculating √(A² + B²) “on a slide rule like the K & E Log Log Deci-trig”.
    * “The key to success with this method depends on the photo-interpreter's having a suitable slide rule. He doesn't have it yet, but will in the future”

* Errors in manual?
* U-2 / Aerial photography sites
