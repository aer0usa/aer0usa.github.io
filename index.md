# Welcome!

Remember when the internet was fun?

When the internet was new and exciting, it was like the Wild West.
I am not a Founding Father of the internet, nor a major pioneer, nor one who staked a claim and got rich, with a community named after me.
I am one of the thousands of faceless homesteaders who found a spot, made a life, moved on when things changed, and found another spot.

Today, this is my little patch of internet.
