# My Work

I have been a Web Application Developer for about twenty years.
I write these apps in JavaScript, or EcmaScript if you prefer.
During the last few years, my work has been in ReactJS.

See my [Software Development page](./development.html) for more information.

## So, why is my web site in static HTML?

Because I think the web is too full of style over substance.
Also, I just like this clean look better.
I added some CSS to make the site responsive for desktop and mobile browsers, but thatâ€™s all.

I may build a web site that is a better showcase for my work at some point.
Today, this is what I want my site to look like.
