Pickett Models 520 &amp; 700</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, as I began to take an interest in slide rules, I started to
look at slide rules on Ebay. Before long, I found a rule called an
“Aerial Photography Slide Rule.” It was a Pickett Model 700, an aluminum
pocket-size slide rule with standard scales on one side. On the other
side, it had scales with interesting labels like “Altitude”, “Focal
Length”, and “Image Size”. Its specialized design and apparent purpose
piqued my curiosity, so I ordered it.</p>
<p>A few days later, I marveled at the little aluminum jewel in my
hands. As I studied it, I began to wonder exactly what problems it was
designed to solve. How did its designers decide on the range of values
for its aerial photo scales? What about the scales on the rule’s
“rear”?</p>
<p>The first source of information I found about the rule was its
operating manual, which I found on the International Slide Rule Museum
web site. The manual described the rule’s basic operation, and some of
the philosophy behind its design. It also told me that the rule was
designed by Amrom H. Katz. Interestingly, it also refers the reader to
an article written by Katz in <strong>Photogrammetric
Engineering</strong>: <em>Contributions to the theory and mechanics of
photo-interpretation from vertical and oblique photographs.</em><a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I liked the Model 700 so much that I found and purchased its big
brother, the Model 520, also from Ebay. This rule came with its
cardboard box, leather case, and original manual.</p>
<p>As I searched for more information about these Aerial Photo Slide
Rules, I stumbled upon Nathan Zeldes’ article “A Calculator Hidden in a
book”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> about a different device designed to
solve a similar problem. Zeldes’ curiosity and exploration of the
Cornell “How Many?” device, along with his mention of the Pickett Model
700, inspired me to research further and to consider writing an article
of my own.</p>
<p>It took me a while to find it, but I did eventually find Katz’s
article in <strong>Photogrammetric Engineering</strong>. Reading this,
and other articles Katz wrote for the Rand Corporation, gave me an
appreciation for the man’s writing style and insight to problems of
aerial photography.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it-for">What Is It For?</h2>
<p><img src="./UsafImages/Representative-Fraction.jpg"
alt="FIGURE 2: Representative Fraction" /> <strong>FIGURE 2:
Representative Fraction</strong></p>
<p>The Aerial Photo Slide Rule was designed primarily to calculate the
representative fraction, or scale, of aerial reconnaissance photographs.
The representative fraction is the ratio of the focal length of the
camera to the altitude from which the photo is taken.</p>
<p>One example from the Model 520/700 manual is that of a photograph
taken with a camera with 36 inch focal length from an aircraft flown at
30,000 feet altitude. The representative fraction for that photograph is
3’:30,000’, or 1:10,000. From there, other information about a
photograph can be extrapolated, such as the size of objects on the
ground, and distances between them.</p>
<p>These problems are just proportions. Proportions are right in a slide
rule’s wheelhouse.</p>
<p>The Royal Air Force had published a set of tables of representative
fractions, image sizes, and resulting ground object sizes for aerial
photography interpreters. First, the Photo-interpreter had to calculate
the representative fraction manually, then look up the image and ground
object sizes in the tables. These tables had many thousands of entries
(maybe millions?), and were cumbersome.</p>
<p>Before designing the Aerial Photo Slide Rule, Katz constructed a
nomograph to help solve representative fractions, but he soon found that
“even a nomograph is somewhat clumsy to use.”<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> so
he constructed an experimental Aerial Photo Slide Rule.</p>
<p>The article shows photos of an early version of the Aerial Photo
Slide Rule, constructed from “inexpensive vinyl plastic.”<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Its
Altitude scale only goes up to 60,000 feet, and its focal length scale
only to 100 inches. Otherwise, its design is similar to the finished
product that appears on the Pickett Aerial Photo Slide Rule.</p>
<h2 id="altitude">Altitude</h2>
<p>The next question that came to my mind was, “How did Katz arrive at a
maximum altitude of 250,000 feet?” As it appeared this rule would have
been designed around 1950, what aircraft would have been used for aerial
photo reconnaissance? This question by itself captured my imagination
for a few weeks, searching for aircraft and aerial reconnaissance
practices in late World War II through the early Fifties.</p>
<p>The first aircraft I thought of were the U-2 and A-12 / SR-71, which
were still years away from their introductions in 1950. Even if the
aerial reconnaissance rule were designed with those future aircraft in
mind, the maximum altitude of the U-2 and SR-71 is 70,000 feet and
85,000 feet respectively, depending on your source of information.</p>
<p>Orbital spy satellites were still several years off in 1950. Sputnik
did not orbit the Earth until 1957, and the perigee of its orbit was
over 700,000 feet, so the altitude doesn't work either.</p>
<p>Maybe a sub-orbital platform launched via rocket? The most likely
example of this would be the German V-2 rocket. Its maximum altitude was
around 291,000’. I found one photo taken from a V-2, but no evidence
that they were commonly used for this purpose, either by the Germans or
Americans.</p>
<p>What about a balloon? I found information about a “Project Genetrix”,
but it seems the maximum altitude for that project was about
100,000’.</p>
<p>I found an interesting web site called <strong>Air Recce</strong><a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> that shares information about aerial
reconnaissance as it was done during World War II. This was exactly what
I needed.</p>
<p>Air Recce and Wikipedia both seem to show that the aircraft used most
for aerial reconnaissance during and just after World War II were
versions of the North American P-51 Mustang known as the F-6, and the
Lockheed P-38 Lightning known as the F-4 and F-5. The F-4 and F-5,
“...as a reconnaissance aircraft, obtained 90 percent of the aerial film
captured over Europe.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Both of these aircraft could fly
over 40,000 feet. Many of the examples in the Model 520/700 manual use
an altitude of 30,000 - 40,000 feet, so it seems likely this is what
Katz had in mind.</p>
<p>Also of interest is the RB-36D, a Photo Reconnaissance version of the
Convair B-36 Peacemaker. This could fly over 50,000 feet, carry multiple
cameras, and had a long range. The RB-36D becomes important in the
discussion about aerial reconnaissance cameras.</p>
<p>I seemed no closer to finding the answer to my question: why a
maximum of 250,000 feet?</p>
<p>I finally found the answer in Katz’s article in
<strong>Photogrammetric Engineering</strong>: “…to permit the use of
this slide rule in <em>oblique photography</em> computations”.<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> (emphasis mine)</p>
<p>The Model 520/700 manual states that “the problems associated with
oblique photography are much more difficult than the corresponding
problems in vertical photography” and that “This slide rule can be used
in conjunction with other aids for oblique photography; these are now
under development…”.</p>
<p>Katz’s article in <strong>Photogrammetric Engineering</strong>
discusses these “other aids”.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The Smithsonian National
Air and Space Museum has a prototype, dated 1949, donated by Katz:<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"

<strong>FIGURE 3: Calculator, Graphic, Oblique, Aerial Type A-1,
Prototype, with 18 Transectors, Smithsonian Air and Space Museum,

<h2 id="focal-length">Focal Length</h2>
<p>“Why a maximum focal length of 240 inches?” I found the answer to
this question as I was researching likely aircraft. In his article, Katz
mentions the K-24 and other cameras with a focal length from 24 to 36
inches. These were often carried by the F-5 and F-6, and Katz refers to
them in examples in his article.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>However, while reading about the RB-36D, I read that it could be
equipped with something called the “Boston Camera”. The Boston Camera
had a focal length of 240 inches, and: “a photo interpreter could detect
a golf ball from an altitude of 45,000 feet (14,000 m).”<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The Boston Camera was not manufactured until 1951, and was used
sparingly. The Boston Camera may not have been used frequently because
it was sensitive to aircraft vibration.<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
Cameras with 24- to 36-inch focal lengths were much more common.</p>
<p>The Pickett Model 520/700 has gauge marks for what are probably
common focal lengths: 24 inch, 36 inch, 48 inch, 72 inch, 96 inch, and
144 inch.</p>
<h2 id="ground-speed">Ground Speed</h2>
<p>The ground speed scale is used to calculate image speed and cycling
time.</p>
<p>The ground speed scale reads up to 1,000 Miles per Hour / Knots. I
didn't find any aircraft likely to be used for aerial reconnaissance
around 1950 with such a high top speed. It is my guess that 1,000 Miles
per Hour was a “nice, round figure” that allowed for future
developments.</p>
<p>The ground speed scale on the rule is used to calculate “image speed”
arising from forward aircraft speed. After aligning the “M.P.H.” mark
with the representative fraction, setting the cursor to the “ground
speed” will show the image speed in Inches Per Second.</p>
<p>The Aerial Photo rule can be used to calculate cycling time between
exposures, how many exposures are required to survey a given area, the
required altitude to photograph an object of a given ground size at a
desired image size, and a minimum altitude given a flight speed and
requirement for sixty percent image overlap on a given size of film. A
sixty percent overlap in adjacent photos produces stereoscopic aerial
views.</p>

<p>This photo interpretation kit includes a Pickett 52T Type-A1 Aerial
Photography Slide Rule, two different Magnifying Stereoscopes, and
Proportional Dividers.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The 52T varies from the Model 520 /
700 by including a “Ground Size Meters” scale in addition to the Ground
Size Feet scale.</p>
<h2 id="rule-orientation">Rule Orientation</h2>
<p>In our correspondence, James Bready noted to me that when switching
from one side of the rule to the other, on most rules, you would rotate
the rule along its long axis, and the rule is still oriented correctly.
However, the Aerial Photography Rule seems to be set up to flip
end-for-end to switch sides of the rule. James pointed out that that
seems to be the case for all of the different makes of aerial
photography rules that he has. I had noticed the same thing, though I
had not given it much thought until then.</p>
<p>Page eight of the manual states, “When the Aerial Photo side of the
slide rule is used, the rule must be held vertically.” When the rule is
held vertically for Aerial Photo use, in the left hand, palm up,
switching to the “rear” of the rule is easy to accomplish by rolling the
left wrist to the right, presenting the rear of the rule in its correct
orientation. I think this is how the rule is meant to be used.</p>

<strong>FIGURE 5: Transition from Front to Rear Scales of the Pickett
Model 700</strong></p>
<h2 id="precision--accuracy">Precision &amp; Accuracy</h2>
<p>I wondered about whether the calculations done with the rule would be
precise and accurate enough to provide useful intelligence for the photo
interpreter. Katz addresses the question of Precision and Accuracy in
his article in PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Briefly stated, precision refers to the reproducibility of the
measurement operation, whereas accuracy refers to the essential truth of
the measurement, i.e. its nearness to the true value.<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a serious and pernicious fallacy to believe that because
computations are made with a modern electric calculator, "answers" can
be written down embodying all the figures cast up by the machinations of
the calculator.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Katz expands on this in some of his other articles.</p>
<p>First, the photo interpreter does not need to find the dimensions of
a ground object down to fractions of an inch. The question is one of
whether the object on the ground is a foxhole, a missile launch site, or
an airfield, for example. From <em>Some Notes on the History of Aerial
reconnaissance</em><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Second, there are other sources of error in the process of obtaining
the aerial photographs. These sources include whether the film lies flat
in the camera, the motion of the shutter with respect to the airplane's
path, errors in measurement of the airplane’s altitude, errors in the
stated focal length of the camera, and whether the photo is actually
vertical. Katz states that these errors can be as much as 10%, whereas
the “Ground Size” scale can be read within 0.1% on the 10” rule. So, the
Aerial Photography rule provides plenty of accuracy for the job at hand.
Katz, PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING, 1950. page 355<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that once the enemy became aware of aerial
photography, he would camouflage the sites to hide what was there.
However, the photo interpreter would make educated guesses based on the
size of the camouflaged area, combined with other sources of
intelligence. Interpretation Of Military Installations From Aerial
Photographs, Jones, p. 498<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="rear-of-the-rule">Rear of the Rule</h2>
<p><img src="./UsafImages/Figure-5.jpg"
alt="FIGURE 6: Rear of Pickett Models 520 &amp; 700" /> <strong>FIGURE
6: Rear of Pickett Models 520 &amp; 700</strong></p>
<p>Katz made a recommendation about what scales should be on the “rear”
of the Aerial Photography rule: “The reverse side of the rule will be a
newly arranged standard 10 inch rule, having the normal, folded and
inverted scales (C, D, CF, DF, DIF, DI), the square and cube scales (A
&amp; K), the sine and tangent scales (S &amp; T), and the log scale
(L).<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>”</p>
<p>Pickett’s selection of scales for the “rear” of the Model 520/700 is
close to Katz’s recommendation: <strong>L, A, DF | CF, CIF, T, S, C | D,
DI, K</strong></p>
<p>James Bready shared images of some Aerial Photography rules that he
has, and the BRL 54 aerial photo rule has the following scales on its
rear: <strong>S&amp;T, A | B, S, T, C | D</strong></p>
<p>So it appears that there is no “standard” for the scales on the rear
of the aerial photography rule, but Pickett’s rules seem to reflect the
scale set that Katz had in mind.</p>
<p>I wondered if it would make sense to have an ST scale to calculate
small angles for “slightly oblique” aerial photos. Or maybe other scales
for triangles with small apex angles, like the scales of the Model 14
Artillery rule?</p>
<p>I was also curious about the inclusion of the CIF scale rather than
the more-common CI scale. Certainly the CIF scale can be used in the
same way as CI, but I would like to know more about this choice.</p>
<p>I found some insight into these scale selections while perusing
Pickett Slide Rule catalogs on the International Slide Rule Museum. The
1954 <em>Pickett All-Metal Slide Rules Catalog 164-A</em><a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
includes not only the Model 520 and 700 “U.S.A.F. AERIAL PHOTO SLIDE
RULES”, but also a Model 706-S.</p>
<p>The Model 706-S is a rule with the same scale set as the “rear” of
the Model 700 on the front, and the rear is blank. The 164-A catalog
calls the scale set a “<em>complete</em> Trig Scale arrangement all on
one side of the rule - available only on Pickett Pocket Rules”. The
catalog markets the 706-S with “Your Imprint On Rule And Case”, with
your company’s product or trade mark on the rear of the rule, or as a
“Special Conversion Rule”, with your company’s own conversion factors on
the rear of the rule.</p>
<p>So, it would appear that the Model 700 is a “Special Conversion
Rule”, but this doesn't answer the question of “which came first, the
700, or the 706-S?”</p>
<p>It is also interesting that while there is a “Full Size Special
Conversion Rule”, it is the 903-S, which has a different, though
similar, scale set from the 520/700: <strong>K A DF | CF T S CI C | D
L</strong></p>
<p>The scale set on the “rear” of the 520 is the same as that of the
700.</p>
<p>Another unique feature of the Model 520/700 is the case. For each of
the rules, its case is the standard leather case for its size, but with
a table of equivalents and settings for conversion factors set into a
window added to the case.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a tool designed to solve an interesting problem, and as a cold war
artifact, the USAF Aerial Photo Slide Rule is an interesting addition to
my slide rule collection. Exploring its origins has been fun, and I find
this aspect of the slide rule hobby one of the most enjoyable. I hope
this exploration has been enjoyable for you as well.</p>
