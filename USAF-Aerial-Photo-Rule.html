<h1 id="pickett-usaf-aerial-photography-slide-rules">Pickett USAF Aerial Photography Slide Rules</h1>
<p>As I began to look at slide rules, I found a Pickett Model 700 on Ebay. Its specialized design and purpose piqued my curiosity, and I ordered it.</p>
<p>A few days later, I marveled at the little aluminum jewel in my hands. As I studied it, I began to wonder exactly what problems it was designed to solve. How did its designers decide on the range of values for its aerial photo scales? What about the scales on the rule’s rear?</p>
<p>The first source of information I found about the rule was its operating manual, which I found on the International Slide Rule Museum. The manual described the rule’s basic operation, and some of the philosophy behind its design. It also told me that the rule was designed by Amrom H. Katz. Interestingly, it also refers the reader to an article written by Katz in <strong>Photogrammetric Engineering</strong>: <em>Contributions to the theory and mechanics of photo-interpretation from vertical and oblique photographs.</em> (reference)</p>
<p>I liked the Model 700 so much that I found and purchased its big brother, the Model 520, also from Ebay. This rule came with its cardboard box, leather case, and original manual.</p>
<p>As I searched for more information about these Aerial Photo Slide Rules, I stumbled upon Nathan Zeldes’ article <a href="https://www.nzeldes.com/HOC/Cornell.htm">“A Calculator Hidden in a book”</a> about a different device designed to solve a similar problem. Nathan’s curiosity and exploration of the “How Many?” device, along with his mention of the Pickett Model 700, inspired me to research further and to consider writing an article of my own.</p>
<p>It took me a while to find it, but I did eventually find Katz’s article in <strong>Photogrammetric Engineering</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it-for">What Is It For?</h2>
<p>The Aerial Photo Slide Rule was designed primarily to calculate the Representative Fraction, or scale, of Aerial Reconnaissance photographs. From there, other information about a photograph can be extrapolated, such as the size of objects on the ground, and distances between them.</p>
<p>These problems are just proportions. Proportions are right in Slide Rules’ wheelhouse.</p>
<p>The R.A.F. had published a set of tables of Representative Fractions, image sizes, and resulting ground object sizes for Aerial Photography Interpreters. First, the Photo-interpreter had to calculate the Representative Fraction, then look up the image and ground object sizes. These tables had many thousands of entries (maybe millions?), and were cumbersome.</p>
<p>Before designing the Aerial Photo Slide Rule, Katz constructed a nomograph to help solve Representative Fractions, but he soon found that “even a nomograph is somewhat clumsy to use” (reference), so he constructed an experimental Aerial Photo Slide Rule.</p>
<p>The article shows photos of an early version of the Aerial Photo Slide Rule, constructed from “inexpensive vinyl plastic”. Its Altitude scale only goes up to 60,000 feet, and its Focal Length scale only to 100 inches. Otherwise, its design is similar to the finished product that appears on the Pickett Aerial Photo Slide Rule.</p>
<h2 id="altitude">Altitude</h2>
<p>The next question that came to my mind was, “How did Katz arrive at a maximum altitude of 250,000 feet?” As it appeared this rule would have been designed around 1950, what aircraft would have been used for aerial photo reconnaissance? This question by itself captured my imagination for a few weeks, searching for aircraft and aerial reconnaissance practices in late World War II through the early Fifties.</p>
<p>The U2 and SR-71 were still years away from their introductions. Even if the Aerial Reconnaissance rule were designed with those future aircraft in mind, the maximum altitude of the U2 and SR-71 is 70,000 feet and 85,000 feet respectively, depending on your source of information.</p>
<p>1950 was much too early for orbital spy satellites. Sputnik did not orbit the Earth until 1957, and its perigee was over 700,000 feet, so the altitude doesn't work either.</p>
<p>Maybe a sub-orbital platform? The most likely example of this would be the German V-2 rocket. Its maximum altitude was around 291,000’. I found one photo taken from a V-2, but no evidence that they were used for this purpose, either by the Germans or Americans.</p>
<p>What about a balloon? I found information about a “Project Genetrix”, but it seems the maximum altitude for that project was about 100,000’.</p>
<p>I found an interesting web site called Air Recce (reference) that shares information about Aerial Reconnaissance as it was done during World War II. This was exactly what I needed. Air Recce and Wikipedia both seem to show that the aircraft used most for Aerial Reconnaissance during and just after World War II were versions of the North American P-51 Mustang known as the F-6, and the Lockheed P-38 Lightning known as the F-4 and F-5. The F-4 and F-5, “...as a reconnaissance aircraft, obtained 90 percent of the aerial film captured over Europe” (reference) Both of these aircraft could fly over 40,000 feet. Many of the examples in the Model 520 / 700 manual use an altitude of 30,000 - 40,000 feet, so it seems likely this is what Katz had in mind.</p>
<p>Also of interest is the RB-36D, a Photo Reconnaissance version of the Convair B-36 Peacemaker. This could fly over 50,000 feet, carry multiple cameras, and had a long range. The RB-36D becomes important in the discussion about Aerial Reconnaissance cameras.</p>
<p>So, why a maximum of 250,000 feet? I finally found the answer in Katz’s article in <strong>Photogrammetric Engineering</strong>: “...to permit the use of this slide rule in oblique photography computations”. (reference) The manual states that “the problems associated with oblique photography are much more difficult than the corresponding problems in vertical photography” and that “This slide rule can be used in conjunction with other aids for oblique photography; these are now under development…”. Katz’s article in <strong>Photogrammetric Engineering</strong> discusses these “other aids”. The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum has a prototype, dated 1949, donated by Katz: <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/calculator-graphic-oblique-aerial-type-1-prototype-18-transectors/nasm_A19930313000">Calculator, Graphic, Oblique, Aerial Type A-1, Prototype, with 18 Transectors</a></p>
<h2 id="focal-length">Focal Length</h2>
<p>“Why a maximum focal length of 240 inches?” I found the answer to this question as I was researching likely aircraft. In his article, Katz mentions the K-24 and other cameras with a focal length from 24 to 36 inches. These were often carried by the F-5 and F-6, and Katz refers to them in examples in his article. (reference) However, why a maximum 240 inch focal length?</p>
<p>While reading about the RB-26D, I read about the “Boston Camera”. The Boston Camera had a focal length of 240 inches, and: “a photo interpreter could detect a golf ball from an altitude of 45,000 feet (14,000 m)” (reference)</p>
<p>However, the Boston Camera was not manufactured until 1951, and was used sparingly. Cameras with 24- to 36-inch focal lengths were much more common.</p>
